### ASA - WebVPN 2 ###

Intelligence believes that not all of the 192.168.28.96/27 network has the ability to communicate with the 192.168.150.224/27 network.

Scheme of Maneuver:
    - Jump Box
    - Network scan: 192.168.28.96/27
    - Network scan:192.168.150.224/27
    - OSs: unknown
    - Creds: student ::
    - Known Ports: unknown
    - Known URL: consulting.site.donovia
    - Known URL: conference.site.donovia
    - Action: Reconnaissance to collect intelligence and identify possible avenues of approach in the network.

##### Answer ####

1. create a dynamic tunnel to the jumpbox -> ssh student@10.50.49.22 -D 9050
2. Run scans to identify available networks -> for i in {97..126} ;do (ping -c 1 192.168.28.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done
3. You will find the hosts... update the diagram to see what your hosts are... 
4. Run nmap scans to see the open ports-> proxychains nmap ip 192.168.28.97-100, 100,105,111,120 -Pn
5. The ip address with the flag was 192.168.28.105, do proxychains wget -r ftp://192.168.28.105 to get the flag.

##### Answer ####

1. From the hosts attached to the jumpbox find out which one has ssh port
2. The hint from the ftp server gave you a file with passwords to try..try those passwords in your ssh connection. 
3. Create local tunnels to each of the boxes that had ssh ports and try accessing them using the credentials. The one that access the connection is obviously the one that you want to run it from. 
4. Do a ping sweep to see which addresses on the box it can connect to. 
5. Utilize the smb ports to and the smd-os-discovery tool from the internet host through the dynamic tunnel 
6.
