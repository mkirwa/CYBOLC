netstat: Short for network statistics, this command displays various network-related information, such as active connections and routing tables.
-a: Shows all active TCP and UDP connections and the TCP and UDP ports on which the computer is listening.
-n: Displays addresses and port numbers in numerical form.
-o: Displays the process ID (PID) associated with each connection, which is useful for identifying which processes are using which ports and connections.
Overall, this command is commonly used for network troubleshooting and monitoring purposes.
