awk -F ':''OFS="-"{print$1,$2,$3}'/etc/passwd



awk -F ':' 'OFS="-"{print$1,$2,$3}' /etc/passwd

This command uses awk to process the contents of the /etc/passwd file. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

-F ':': This sets the field separator to a colon (:). This means awk will treat each colon-separated value in a line as a separate field. In the /etc/passwd file, lines are usually formatted as username:password:UID:GID:full_name:home_directory:shell.

OFS="-": This sets the output field separator to a hyphen (-). This determines how awk will join fields together when it prints them out.

{print $1,$2,$3}: This instructs awk to print the first, second, and third fields of each line (i.e., username, password, and UID).

In summary, the command will read the /etc/passwd file and print the username, password, and UID for each line, separated by hyphens. For example, if a line in /etc/passwd reads:

hardware abstraction layer - HALDLL

bcdedit --> gives information about how the computer spins up.... 
ntoskernel - windows version of kernel
