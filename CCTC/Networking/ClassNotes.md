YOUR MACHINE KIRWA -> ssh -X student@10.50.39.135

Hostname: BLUE-INTERNET_HOST-student_11 IP: 10.50.39.135 Username: student Password: password

Convert ip address to hex -> https://www.browserling.com/tools/ip-to-hex

-X enables use of graphics can open things like wireshack.

ssh keys are located in .ssh server... the (.) means it's a hidden folder 
netstat is being deprecated and being replaced by ss. ifconfig is also being depracated and being replaced by ip. 
ifconfig might require root access. 

ss -antl -> list all ip addresses, n means number t means tcp and l means listening.... 
terminator helps with splitting screens... 

Hostname: BLUE-INTERNET_HOST-student_11 IP: 10.50.39.135 Username: student Password: password

how to open terminator -> terminator & (the & makes sure that it runs in the background)

eom bl

eom blue_range_complete.png -> opens png 

ip a 

eog blue_range_complete.png -> opens a png

cat README -> has instructions for a lit of some useful commands on
pcmanf -> opens a file manager... 

ssh, telnet, http ! colon and then a port if you're using http. 

## SLIDE 1 -> OUTCOMES ##

Layer 1 - understand bits and bytes
Layer 2 - Layer 2 equipment, vlan, ARP -> Address Resolution Protocol 

Understand what Address Resolution Protocol means... Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a procedure that connects a dynamic IP address to a fixed physical machine address in a local area network (LAN). The physical machine address is also known as a media access control (MAC) address.

TCP -> at the transport layer they're called segments and at the UDP, they're called Datagrams. 
You can view layer 5 (sessions) using netstat  or ss -> shows open connections! 

### Layer 1 ###

Binary 
Base2 -> Two symbols (0 and 1)
128(2^7)..................1(2^0)

1 byte = byte 
2 bytes = halfword 
4 bytes = word 

A nibble is half a byte = 4 bits 

0-16 = hexadecimal value. 
base 10 - ten symbols (0 to 9, A - F)
Look at the diagram hex 0*94 = 148 as a decimal. 

Base64 - 64 (A-Z,a-z, 0-9, +,/)
place values - 2^0.................2^5
Base 64 has to be a minimum grouping of 4

#### Topologies ####

BUS - > 
STAR -> 
Ring -> like bus but loops back
Mesh -> 
Wireless -> 
Hierarchial -> Core, Distribution, Access

Ethernet timing see slides. 

#### Data link sub-layers ####
MAC -> Medium Access Control 
LLC -> Logical Link Control 

Has to bridge between physical and logical MAC deals with physical and LLC deals with logical. 
MTU -> maximum transmission unit. How much data you can send inside the layer 2 frame. Default limit for mtu is 1500 bytes. 

whta is FCS/CRC. 

Ethernet header -> destination mac and source mac 

Switch attacks
CAM Table Overflow attack 
MAC addresses are 48-bit | 6 bytes | 12 hex 

Look at he slides for the format. 

Look at the 8 bit to identify if a MAC address is a unicast or a multi-cast. 
It's easy nowadays to spoof a mac address because they're no longer burned in and can be changed by coding it with software. 

VLAN TYPES 
- default vlan 
- data vlan 
- voice - VOIP 
- Management - Switch and router management
- Native - Untagged traffic

What addresses change during data transfer? Is it source addresses or destination addresses... 

VLAN hopping -> What is this? 

RARP request and wait for an RARP reply? 
GRATUITOUS ARP ????

BPDUs and STP 

### Layer 2 ###
Practice of "borrowing" host bits and used them as subnet bits. 
How fragmentations can be used to perform attacks!!!
IPV4 Auto configuration vulnerability 
- Rogue DHCP 
- Evil Twin
- DHCP Starvation 

Traceroute port using udp is port 53 and using tcp is 80?

sudo tcpdump host 8.8.8.8 -n
sudo traceroute 8.8.8.8 -T 

ICMPV4 Attacks
ICMP
SMURF attack
ICMP Covert Channels
Oversized ICMP messages
Firewalking (traceroute)

IPV6 packets will always be 40 bytes long. 

Summary addresses... the addresses that are advertised. 

P@cket_C@rv1ng

N3tw0rkFund3m3nt@ls


Task 1: Frame and Packet H0eaders
START FLAG: P@cket_C@rv1ng


Utilize the /home/activity_resources/pcaps/packet-headers.pcapng for this activity.

CISCO switches - CDP 
Router Information - RIP

### Application Layer ###

ICMP port unreachable if there's no firewall and the connection is lost. 

sshd - refers to ssh daemon. Your processes.... like what port you're listening to? 
x11forwarding -> don't have to allow it... turn it off if you don't want people to export graphics...allows graphics to come back. 

Where is DNS located... understand this... review TCP handshake and understand the fundamentals.... 
ACK number, SYNC number, MSS, packet size and MTU (maximum transmission unit)



Task 2: Packet Payloads
START FLAG: Wh@t_P@load?

# TRAFFIC CAPTURE #

Libpcap - library pcap -> tcpdump.org
WinPcap - windows pcap -> winpcap.org
NPcap - nmap pcap -> nmap.org/npcap.

This flag will be released by Mission Command.

Flag Formats for all Basic Analysis Challenges

tcpdump flags:

COMMAND: tcpdump filter syntax
FLAG: filter syntax

BPFCheck.pcap can be found on your INTERNET_HOST in /home/activity_resources/pcaps

To find the packet count, you can append | wc -l after your command. For example tcpdump -n "yourfilter" -r BPFCheck.pcap | wc -l

### TCP Dump primitivies ###

- user friendly expressions
    - src or dst 
    - host or net -> Host cares about that device and net any othe device. 
    - tcp or udp -> Looking for internet traffic.

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -> Captures everything... Capture packets network packts on the eth0 neteork interface. -i specifies the network interface in this case eth0 and not eth1 or wlan0 or wlan1. 

type -> host, net, port or port-range
dir -> src or dest
proto -> particular protocols either ether, arp, ip, ip6, icmp, tcp or udp

-A -> print payload and ASCI -> sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -A
-D -> list interfaces -> sudo tcpdump -D
-i -> specifiy capture interface -> sudo tcpdump -i eth0
-e -> print data-link  headers -> sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -e
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -n -> list ip and port 
-X or XX -> print payload in HEX and ASCII -> sudo tcpdump -i eth0 
-w -> write to pcap 
-r -> read from pcap
-v, vv, or vvv -> verbosity -> sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -v -> Determines how much detail should be output in the view below.
-n -> no inverse lookups 

### Logical Operators ###
- Primitives may be combined using:
    - Concatenation: 'and' (&&) ->  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -e tcp port
    - Alteration: 'or' (||)
    - Negation: 'not' (!) -> sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -e tcp port not 22 ->  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -e tcp port ! 22
    -  sudo tcpdump -i eth0 -e host not 192.168.242.193

- < or <= 
- > or >=
- = or != 

Hostname: BLUE-INTERNET_HOST-student_11 IP: 10.50.39.135 Username: student Password: password

sudo tcpdump -i eth0 port ! 22 -d -> -d lists the steps....

TODO??? Revisit packet content and see how they're structured!!! 


sudo tcpdump -i eth0 'tcp[0:2]=22 || tcp[2:2]=22' -> Capture ssh traffic coming from the source -

### BITWISE MASKING ###

ALOT TO BE STUDIED?????TODO---REVIEW CLASS NOTES AND UNDERSTAND THAT VERY WELL


### BITWISE MASKING ###
