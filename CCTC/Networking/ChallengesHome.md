OS                          uname -a

Open ports                  tcp ports: netstat -antp | grep -i listen or nc localhost 23 or telnet localhost 23

Copy the scan.sh file

Run the file: ./scan.sh

Network addr: 172.16.120

Host range: 1

Ending host range: 1

Ports: 21-23 80

This will give the IP of the next host/router

Now, we know the IP let get into that IP

Ssh vyos@172.16.120.1

To start the flag

1. dig txt networking-ctfd-1.server.vta

On answer section there is a file: cmVhZHlfc2V0X3NjYW4=

Decode rhis: from base64 to UTF-8

2. To get the hostname 

ssh net{N}_studentX@provided_ip_address # provided in the notification i.e. ssh net4_student25@10.50.24.163 then enter the password25

after that, 

Ssh vyos@172.16.120.1 # Enter the provided password

3. How many host(s) did you discover on the DMZ Net? (excluding the router)

nmap â€“sn 172.16.101.30/27 --- gives how many hosts are up
